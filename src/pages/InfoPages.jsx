                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    In some cases, order cancellation may attract a <strong>5.5% bank charge</strong>, depending on the payment method used. This is because payment gateway providers retain their transaction fees even if an order is cancelled and refunded.
