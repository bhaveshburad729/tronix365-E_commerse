## 🚀 Novice-to-Expert Quick Run Guide

If you want to run this application locally from scratch as quickly as possible, follow this step-by-step guide.

### 📋 Prerequisites

First, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js** (LTS Version recommended) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Python 3.10+** - [Download here](https://www.python.org/)
3. _Optional_: **PostgreSQL** (only if you want a production-grade database instead of the built-in SQLite)

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Installation

#### ⚙️ Part 1: Backend Setup (FastAPI Server)

1. **Open a terminal** (PowerShell/CMD on Windows, or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tronix365-E_commerse
   ```

2. **Navigate into the backend folder**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment (`myenv`):**
   This isolates your Python dependencies so they do not conflict with other projects.
   - **Windows (Command Prompt / CMD):**
     ```cmd
     python -m venv myenvenv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```
   - **Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```powershell
     python -m venv myenv
     .\myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
     _(Note: If you get a script execution policy error in PowerShell, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` first)_
   - **macOS / Linux:**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

   O
   mynce activated, your terminal prompt will display `(myenv)`.

4. **Install Python dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables (`.env`):**
   Create a file named `.env` inside the `backend` folder. Copy and paste the following configuration:

   ```env
   # Database Settings (SQLite is the simplest for local testing - no installation required!)
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./tronix365.db

   # Security
   SECRET_KEY=generated_secret_key_change_me_in_production
   ALGORITHM=HS256
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
   CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

   # Email Configurations (SMTP Server - Brevo API example)
   BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key_here
   CONTACT_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com

   # PayU payment credentials (for test environments)
   PAYU_ENV=TEST
   PAYU_KEY=xFdsL0
   PAYU_SALT=VOo7u1I9JuewBQQwyA1X9PvonouDaDex
   ```

6. **Initialize and Seed the Database:**
   We have a helper script that automatically drops/creates tables and populates them with initial mock products and an admin account.
   Run this command from your active environment terminal:

   ```bash
   python seed.py
   ```

   This will output `Successfully seeded products and admin user!`.
   - **Default Admin Account:** `admin@tronix365.in`
   - **Default Admin Password:** `adminpassword123`

   _(Optional)_ To create a custom admin user, run:

   ```bash
   python create_admin.py
   ```

7. **Start the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   The FastAPI API documentation will now be interactive at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

---

#### 💻 Part 2: Frontend Setup (React & Vite)

1. **Open a new terminal tab/window** and navigate to the project root directory:

   ```bash
   cd tronix365-E_commerse
   ```

2. **Install Node packages**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Frontend Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173/e-commerse/](http://localhost:5173/e-commerse/) in your browser. You can now register/login, add products to the cart, apply coupon codes, and browse the admin panel!

## 📦 Bulk Product CSV Import & Image Management

The platform includes an automated bulk import engine (`import_products.py`) to import or update hundreds of products directly into your database (SQLite locally or NeonDB in production).

### 1. File Locations & Structure
* **CSV File**: Save your Excel file as CSV UTF-8 at: `backend/products.csv`
* **Images Folder**: Place product images inside: `backend/components/`
  *(Supported extensions: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.svg`)*

### 2. CSV Columns
| Column Header | Required? | Description & Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `skv` | **YES** | Unique SKU code (e.g. `ARD-001`). Duplicate SKUs auto-append unique suffixes. |
| `title` | **YES** | Product Name (e.g. `Arduino Uno R3`). |
| `category` | **YES** | Category name for storefront filters (e.g. `Development Boards`). |
| `sale_price` | **YES** | Selling Price customer pays (e.g. `450`). |
| `mrp` | No | Original Price displayed strikethrough (e.g. `650`). |
| `stock` | No | Available stock count (default: `100`). |
| `image` | **YES** | Filename in `components/` or direct HTTP/HTTPS web link. |
| `description` | No | Detail description text. |
| `features` | No | Bullet list separated by `|` (e.g. `5V Logic|USB-C|ATmega328P`). |
| `specs` | No | Technical key-values separated by `|` & `:` (e.g. `Voltage:5V|Memory:2KB`). |

### 3. Smart Resiliency Features
* **Multi-Encoding Auto-Detect**: Auto-detects `UTF-8`, `UTF-8-SIG`, `CP1252`, and `Latin-1` encodings with fallback `errors="replace"` to prevent charmap decode crashes from Excel symbols.
* **Smart Image Matcher**: Case-insensitive and title-fallback image matching (e.g. matches `16x2 LCD Display` to `16x2 LCD Display.jpg`).
* **Automatic `uploads/` Sync**: Copies matched images from `components/` into `backend/uploads/` and links `/uploads/filename.jpg` in the database.

### 4. Import Commands
```powershell
cd backend
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Import / Update existing products
python import_products.py products.csv

# Wipe DB and fresh re-import (IDs reset to 1)
python import_products.py products.csv --reset
```

### 5. Syncing Images for Live Hosting (Render + NeonDB + Hostinger)
When deploying images to your live website:
```powershell
git add backend/uploads
git commit -m "feat: sync product images for live site"
git push origin main
```
Render automatically deploys the uploaded image directory, serving all product images live at `https://tronix365-e-commerse.onrender.com/uploads/`.

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQs

### 1. PowerShell Script Execution Policy Error (Windows)

**Error:** `Script cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`
**Solution:** Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```

Then try activating the virtual environment again.

### 2. Port Collision (Address Already In Use)

**Error:** `[Errno 10048] error while attempting to bind on address ('127.0.0.1', 8000)`
**Solution:** This means another service (or a lingering uvicorn process) is running on port 8000.
You can run uvicorn on a different port:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080
```

_Note: If you change the backend port, remember to update the base URL in the frontend Axios configuration._

### 3. Missing Node Modules

**Error:** `vite: command not found`
**Solution:** Ensure you ran `npm install` in the project root directory before running `npm run dev`.

### 4. Database Schema Changes

If you modify database models and need to recreate the database tables, you can easily re-run the seeding script:

```bash
python seed.py
```

_(Warning: Running seed.py drops existing tables and resets the local database)._

- **Lifetime Media Storage & Cloudinary CDN Integration**:
  - **Dual-Tier Self-Healing Persistence**: Uploaded images and videos are written to disk and backed up permanently as binary `BYTEA` data in the PostgreSQL database (`UploadedMediaDB`). If Render container restarts/redeploys wipe the ephemeral filesystem, `/uploads/{filename}` automatically queries PostgreSQL, restores the file to disk, and serves it with 200 OK.
  - **Cloudinary CDN Ready**: Pre-configured automatic switchover. Add `CLOUDINARY_URL` (e.g. `cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME`) to Render Environment Variables to instantly route all uploads to Cloudinary's global media CDN with zero disk dependencies.

## 🌐 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Google Search Console Architecture

Tronix365 features a dual-layer SEO architecture engineered specifically for single-page application (SPA) indexing across search engines like Google:

### 1. Server-Side Crawler Interception (`public/index.php` & Apache `.htaccess`)
* **Strict HTTPS & www Normalization**: Enforces 301 Permanent Redirects for all traffic from HTTP or non-www to `https://www.tronix365.in/e-commerse/`.
* **301 Canonical Slug Redirects**: Automatically intercepts numeric product ID requests (`/product/123`) or unnormalized slugs and permanently redirects (HTTP 301) to the canonical slug (`/product/canonical-slug`), eliminating GSC duplicate canonical warnings.
* **True HTTP 404 Status Enforcement**: If a non-existent product or invalid URL is accessed, `index.php` issues a genuine `404 Not Found` header with `noindex, follow` robots meta tag, preventing "Soft 404" errors in Search Console.
* **Dynamic Dynamic Category & Product Schema**: Injects Product, BreadcrumbList, and FAQPage JSON-LD schemas directly into the initial HTML response before rendering.

### 2. Client-Side Parity (`SEO.jsx` & React Router)
* **Auto-Canonical Resolution**: `<SEO />` automatically derives and normalizes canonical URLs based on the active route, preventing subpages (`/about`, `/contact`, `/categories`, etc.) from defaulting to the homepage.
* **Shop vs Category Differentiation**: Distinguishes `/shop` (`.../shop`) from category listings (`.../category/:category`), preventing conflicting canonical definitions.

### 3. Automated Sitemap Engine (`scripts/generate-sitemap.cjs`)
* Automatically runs during `npm run build` to query the live API (or fallback `products_metadata.json`) and writes an up-to-date, valid XML sitemap directly to `public/sitemap.xml` and `dist/sitemap.xml`.
* Synchronized homepage trailing slash (`https://www.tronix365.in/e-commerse/`) ensures 100% parity with server-side canonical declarations.
